## Hello, I'm Sergiu, a Front-End Developer with a Passion for Crafting Beautiful Digital Experiences.

My journey into the world of coding began back in 2020 after ten dedicated years in the production department at Instat Ltd (now part of [Huddle](https://www.hudl.com/en_gb/products/instat)). When the opportunity arose to join the Engineering team, I seized it eagerly. Starting with CSS, HTML, and basic JavaScript from online courses and boot camps, I soon found myself delving into React with Styled Components, which opened up a whole new world of possibilities.

Under the mentorship of my team lead, I embarked on a journey of learning React and Typescript, which led me to tackle real tasks and challenges, contributing to the development of complex platforms. Witnessing my work being used by prestigious soccer clubs and coaches around the world was both exhilarating and motivating, driving me to continuously improve and innovate.

In 2021, I took a leap and relocated to Italy, where I joined a dynamic and tight-knit team at [Kuama](https://www.kuama.net/). Here, I have been fortunate to work on diverse and exciting projects for clients across various industries, including marketing, manufacturing, banking, and retail. Collaborating with this team and utilizing the latest modern programming tools has been an enriching experience that has further honed my skills.

### What Sets Me Apart:

- **Passion for Innovation**: I approach every project with a drive to explore new technologies and find innovative solutions that elevate user experiences.
- **Adaptability and Versatility**: Working on diverse projects has taught me to adapt quickly and effectively, allowing me to thrive in various environments.
- **Strong Team Player**: I value collaboration and believe in the power of teamwork to deliver exceptional results.

Looking forward to getting to know you and your projects better!
